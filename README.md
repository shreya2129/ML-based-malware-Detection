# ML-based-malware-Detection
With the rapid evolution of technology, the threat landscape for cybersecurity has become increasingly sophisticated, with malware being a pervasive and persistent menace. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of various machine learning (ML) techniques for malware detection and mitigation. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of different ML algorithms in identifying and combating malware threats.Several ML algorithms, including but not limited to Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and clustering techniques, are examined in terms of their suitability for malware detection. The dataset used for evaluation comprises diverse samples of malware, representing various types and levels of complexity ,it includes Ransomeware,Trojan horse and, Spyware

1. Ransomware is a malicious software that encrypts a user's files or denies access to their system. Typically delivered through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or compromised websites, ransomware encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible. The attackers demand a ransom, often in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key or restoring access to the affected system. The impact of ransomware can be severe, causing significant data loss, business disruption, and financial harm if the ransom is not paid. Prevention strategies include regular data backups, the use of reputable antivirus and anti-ransomware tools, and user education to recognize and avoid phishing attempts.

2. Spyware is a form of malware designed to clandestinely monitor and collect user information without their knowledge or consent. Operating stealthily in the background, spyware captures sensitive data such as keystrokes, browsing habits, and login credentials. It often infiltrates systems through bundled software or drive-by downloads from compromised websites. Spyware's objectives range from identity theft to corporate espionage. Prevention measures involve using security software to detect and remove spyware, implementing firewalls to block unauthorized access, and educating users to be cautious about downloading unfamiliar software or visiting untrusted websites.

3. Trojan Horse, or Trojan, is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software while containing malicious code. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not replicate but can open a backdoor on the infected system, allowing unauthorized access. Trojans are commonly delivered through email attachments, software downloads, or compromised websites. Once executed, they can carry out various malicious actions, such as stealing data or facilitating other forms of malware. Prevention strategies involve downloading software only from trusted sources, using antivirus programs capable of detecting Trojans, and exercising caution when opening email attachments or clicking on links, especially from unknown sources.

Machine learning (ML) is a potential approach to deal with the dynamic and complicated nature of malware threats. Machine learning algorithms provide the capability to examine extensive information, discern trends, and adjust to changing attack techniques. This project conducts a comparative investigation of different machine learning approaches, aiming to evaluate their efficacy in detecting and mitigating malware. The study assesses the effectiveness of various algorithms and investigates their suitability in practical situations, taking into account criteria such as computational efficiency and scalability.
